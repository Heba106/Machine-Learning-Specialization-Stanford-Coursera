# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

The first Course in Machine Learning Specialization authorized by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University and
offered through Coursera
## Throughout this course I learnt how to:

- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy & scikit-learn
- Build & train supervised machine learning models for prediction & binary classification tasks, including linear regression & logistic regression
